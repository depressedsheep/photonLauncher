Pseudo-official Github account for the Photonics Lab at Hwa Chong Institution. ~~~The school admin doesn't know that this exists, nor do they have to.~~~

**Documentation for individual scripts / experiments can be found in their respective folders.**

Scripts to extract, process and plot data from various equipment present in our photonics lab. Highly WIP.

Use ```sys.path.insert(0, '../helpers/')``` to access libraries in ```helpers```.

Also has tools for system administration in our Linux network.

## Equipment list

Finished:
- Oscilloscope, Lecroy 9384TM (this is ancient)
- Thorlabs TDC001 Controller Cube (CR1-Z7, MTS25-Z8)
- Avalanche Photon Detectors (built at NUS)

Still in the pipeline:
- OceanOptics Spectrometer, USB2000 and USB4000
- TSP001 Temperature and Humidity sensor

## Overview of Experiments

Note: naming conventions are still fairly inconsistent, expect them to change.

If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path. The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it. I get carried away with this brush cleaning I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here. So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. The little tiny Tim easels will let you down.

But we're not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it. Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them out. It's amazing what you can do with a little love in your heart. Just make little strokes like that. We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us. This present moment is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing it.

In your world you have total and absolute power. Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk. Let's make a happy little mountain now. It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. Itâ€™s about to freeze me to death.

Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one. We have a fantastic little sky! You can get away with a lot. And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening - you just let it happen. You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen. Poor old tree.

### oceanoptics

Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain. We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it one canvas. Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now.
