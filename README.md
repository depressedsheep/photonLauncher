## Overview of Experiments

We don't have anything but happy trees here. Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain. Don't be bashful drop me a line. Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day. I'm going to mix up a little color. Weâ€™ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue. All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind.

*Documenation for individual scripts / experiments can be found in their respective folders.*
