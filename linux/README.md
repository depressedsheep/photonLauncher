# Linux Helper Files

Here, files that were used for customization or configuration is stored here.
This includes scripts, motd, etc.

Mostly for archival and backup purposes.

## quotes.txt
Copy and pasted stuff. Need to update as time goes by.....

Arranged by time. Top is the earliest (2 Dec, 2013)
Some 2 liners are combined into 1 line just cus.
The following are generally not pasted in:
- Links
- Salutations (```meow```s and other non-usual signoffs are however kept)
- Lines with just names of people (e.g. ```zy:```)

Lists might be irritating but I'm just gonna include

To be used by .bash_login on robin (or anywhere else should you wish)

Feel free to filter as you wish. Nobody's gonna bite you because you removed a few lines from that file.
