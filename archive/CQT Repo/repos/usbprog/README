This is the device driver plus applications directory for the serial
programmer, based on the miniusb breakout board.

Currently, this directory provides:
- a kernel driver to talk to the USB device and passes it the commands for
  programming, together with a hotplug script

- an application to generate a jtag pattern from a SVN file. This was
  successfully used to program a Lattice semiconductor CPLD, but a few
  features of the SVN specification are not implemented on the miniusb
  hardware, so YMMV.

FILES:

2.6/	Directory containing the kernel driver for the "usbprog" module and
	a header file shared with the FX2 firmware.

hotplug/ Directory which contains the udev rule set for loading the module on
         plugin. Still needs to adapted to have permissions compatible with
         debian-based distros

apps/   Directory with programming applications. So far there is:

 jtagprog.c    A program that eats a SVN file and generates a JTAG pattern
                out of it . has been tested to work with a Lattice 4032 CPLD.

 atmtest.c     Currently a stub. Intended to program ATMEGA and related chips.

 psocprog.c    Currently a stub. Intended to program PSoC3 and related chips.


TO DO:

- Implement the SWD/JTAG protocol to program the PSoC devices from an intel
   hex file. 
- Implementation of an uploader for the ATMEL chips
- Documentation of how to use things
