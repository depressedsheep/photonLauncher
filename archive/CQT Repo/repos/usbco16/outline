the usbco16 adapter framework is to replace the nudaq card and associated
drivers.

The driver here is intended to be used with the usb/co16 adapter card, but
should be easily changable to meet the needs for other large bandwidth digital
IO needs.

For the co16 adapter card, the following line assignments are used for the FX2
chip:

PA port: 

PA0-6: via a 573 buffer stage to pins 1-7, meant for digital output

FD0-FD15: input pins 9-24 terminated to 0v/3.3V with 220 ohm each, then
followed by a lcx573 buffer stage, feeding into the FD0-15 lines of the FX.

CTL0: via a lcx573 buffer to pin 33 of the SCSI output; will be IACK

RDY0: input pin, pin 34 terminated with 220 ohm into 0V/3.3V each, wil be ireq

Basic firmware requirements:

EP1 codes for controlling flow:
- switching on EP2 flow (with waveform select parameter)
- switching off EP2 flow
- setting port A data
- readback of port a data
- some code which returns the card configuration if not provided by the core
usb parameters.
- program disable timer and start unit (special treatment of driver for PA pin
xx
- bit set/reset command for port A bits
- readback timer status
- readback transferred bytes or buffer state
- commit packet


EP2 is input bulk port for data transfer

the current data transfer scheme uses an asynchronous transfer mechanism; we
shoud allow for simpler codes with no ack phase as well

Perhaps we can recycle the timestamp card firmware
