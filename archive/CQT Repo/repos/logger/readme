This is some program collection for temperature logging. The thing is
yet not self-configuring, and it has still hardcoded paths in it. A few
things  to remember when setting it up:

- choose the correct device address. This is hardcoded in the doread script in
  this directory.
- make sure that a log directory exists. Its location is hardcoded in the
  doread script, and there should be a link from the htdocs directory.
- make sure that there is a getresponse program. Path is hardcoded into doread
  scrpt
- install the logger program with crontab -i doread.cron
- enable apache2 as a web server
- copy the files from htdoc in this install directory into the server document
  root (usually /srv/www/htdocs)
- copy the cgi scripts into the cgi directory root (usually /srv/www/cgi-bin)
- make sure the server has a image directory that is wriable by the user
  wwww:wwwrun
