Status of this document: 25.7.2010 - update to two counter cards on one PC

This is a directory which contains a counter program using the signal emerging
out of the timestamp card. 
After a painful re-re-re-discovery of the same problems, this should contain a
consolidated version of the core getrate.c file, and a counter script which
uses this C code to process the output of the timestamp card.

The script uses gnuplot as a graphical front end, but it
can be disabled due to the lately observed performance issues with the X
driver version.

It also has the ability to enter a coincidence time window and a coincidence
correction option that allows to look for singles and coincidences.

Files in this directory:

getrate.c:		code of the conversion program from the crypto suite
counterscript:		TCL/Tk script for displaying things
counterscript2:         Same as above, but with an option to select between
			several timestamp cards on the same machine. If an
			additional parameter is given in the "other" entry
			field, it should be the device node for the time stamp
			card, e.g. /dev/ioboards/timestamp0 or something to
			that effect. Still to be tested.
Makefile:		for compiling the getrate thing
README:			this file

Other information necessry to use this program:

The usbtimestamp card driver must be installed on the system to talk to the
hardware. This is currently contained in the usbtimetagdriver
directory. Furthermore, the digesting program (readevents3) for raw timestamp
events must be present, that is currently in the timestamp3 directory.

The location of the readevents program is coded in the top section of the
cnt_tmstmp_fresh script. Adjust if you store stuff in other places.

This code has been tested on suse 10.0, 10.3 x86_64 and some xubuntu machines
