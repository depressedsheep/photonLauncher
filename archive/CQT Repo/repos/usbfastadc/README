This is the device driver plus applications directory for the 
fast adc unit, together with some jtag programming code. Initially based on
the code for the serial programmer.

Currently, this directory provides:
- a kernel driver to talk to the USB device and passes it the commands for
  programming, together with a hotplug script

- an application to generate a jtag pattern from a SVN file. This was
  successfully used to program a Lattice semiconductor CPLD, but a few
  features of the SVN specification are not implemented.

FILES:

2.6/	Directory containing the kernel driver for the "usbfastadc" module and
	a header file shared with the FX2 firmware.

hotplug/ Directory which contains the udev rule set for loading the module on
         plugin.

apps/   Directory with programming application. So far there is:

 jtagprog.c    A program that eats a SVN file and generates a JTAG pattern
                out of it.

TO DO:

- make programming driver work
- implement SPI transfer commands plus apps
- implement wide bandwidth part of driver
